PURPOSE:  The following is the description of the Texture class.  To use, simply pass the filename
of a 24-bit per pixel Bitmap image to the constructor or call the loadTexBMP method. Bitmaps
should be at least 32 pixels in width and height and the width must be a multiple of four.
If your image does not meet these requirements, you can easily modify it using MS Paint.  Just
follow these steps:
1) Open the image in MS Paint
2) Select the "Resize" option from the "Home" menu.  Click on the "Pixels" option and with
"Maintain aspect ratio" selected, specify the closest multiple of 4 to your image
for the "Horizontal" value.  Click "OK".
3) Now, choose to "Save as" then "BMP picture".  In the box that pops up, select "24-bit Bitmap"
from the "Save as type:" drop down list.  Click "Save".

Acknowledgment #1: The idea for this class is based on the c functions written
by Nate Miller on 5/5/1999 for handling texture mapping using TGA images.
(see http://www.essi.fr/~buffa/cours/synthese_image/DOCS/Tutoriaux/Nate/index-6.htm)

Acknowledgment #2: Later, this class was modified to support transparent tectures,
i.e. portions of an image are invisible.  This is often used when constructing billboards.
Passing the parameter "addAlpha" to the load method (or constructor) adds an alpha bit of 0
to the pixels where the image is black.  Other colors will be given an alpha of 255.  With
appropriate blending parmeters set, the black portions of the image can be made invisible.
The idea for this comes from the text "OpenGL Game Programming", by Kevin Hawkins
and Dave Astle, pages 434-438.

Acknowledgement #3:  In 2010 a bug was resolved that kept some 24-bit Bitmaps from loading correctly.
At this time the class was also modified to support printing of some of the header information to the
screen. Header info is printed if true is passed as the 4th parameter to loadTexBMP or the
constructor.  Thank you to those who provided suggestions (such as Michael Casolary) that helped
to resolve this issue.
